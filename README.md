Not the most excited with how this has turned out so far, but the above is what i have right now.
The timer i have not yet included, nor is the highscore. And I have been wrestling with the start button, trying to get it so 
the start button is the only beginning button, then you would click and the quiz would come in.
Java has been a little more time consuming and difficult for me I feel, but I wanted to at least get something in for grading.
I will continue to fix this one up, and see where I can go wtih it after.
